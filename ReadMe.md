# EMBEDDED PROJECT

The Aim of this project is to demonstrate a PCB-level prototype of a wireless wrist pulse recording platform.
## Arduino IDE

First we have implemented a bread board level circuit(wired connections) using heart rate sensors(MAX 30102),ESP32 and a Multiplexer(TCA9548A)(to connect the sensors at different addresses).
